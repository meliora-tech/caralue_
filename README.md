## About The Project

<img src="static/images/website.PNG" alt="home-page">

<p>Thinking about selling your car?</p>

<p>The pandemic really upended a lot of people's lives.
Jobs are gone, prices are increasing, government has no concrete plans to stimulate growth and we still need
to live.  Part of surviving this challenging period has been to dip into savings and doing a lot of cost 
reduction.  </p>

<p>One of the biggest cost probably is the car installment.  Selling your car or paying a less amount can go
a long way into surviving the current economic climate. But how much is your car going for? Caralue is here
to help with that.  </p>

<p>We collect prices of different car brands from several online sources to give you an estimate of how your car
is probably worth in the market. Of course several other factors may come into play when you decide to sell
your car. But it never hurts to have a ballpark figure before entering the market. </p>
